TASK 1 : RESPONSIVE LANDING PAGE

PAGE NAME : CarScrubz

WEBSITE: [https://carscrubz.netlify.app/](https://carscrubz.netlify.app/)

THEME : Car Washing Website

DESCRIPTION:-

The first task involved creating a responsive landing page, which required me to ensure that the webpage adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. 
This task allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of responsive design principles and techniques.
Create an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. 
The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages. Use HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity, 
such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over. 

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: HTML, CSS, JAVACRIPT
