THEME : Stop Watch

DESCRIPTION:-

To build a stopwatch web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times, users can accurately measure and record time intervals. With these technologies and functionalities, you can create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.
The second task involved developing a stopwatch web application. This required me to utilize JavaScript to create a functional stopwatch that accurately measures time. Through this task, I not only honed my JavaScript skills but also gained valuable experience in implementing interactive features on a webpage.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: HTML, CSS, JAVACRIPT
